## Use Linting

The linting tools are powerful aids to help identify common pitfalls and
anti-patterns that can impede engineer and product success.  They also help
streamline the review process, enabling engineers to provide quality feedback
focused on solving the product and engineering problems at hand, as well as
empowering the authoring engineer to maintain and improve code quality for
their products.
